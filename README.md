# Fake News Classifier

The **Fake News Classifier** is a machine learning model designed to detect fake news articles. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and classification techniques to distinguish between real and fake news content based on features extracted from the text.


## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and process news articles to prepare the data for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilize techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract features from news articles.
- **Model Training**: Use various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM (Support Vector Machines) to train the classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
